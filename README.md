# 🎉 Hi there, you've arrived at Jahnavi's Portfolio 🎉

## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my little corner of the internet ✨
I’m a Software Engineer × Machine Learning Engineer currently leveling up with a Master’s in Software Engineering at San José State University. I love building things that actually work, scale well, and don’t fall apart when real users show up.


## 💼 Experience

**Software Engineer — Debula Labs**  
Built and shipped real-world backend systems that didn’t blink under load. Worked on APIs, large-scale databases, and containerized microservices — optimizing performance, improving reliability, and making sure things stayed fast when usage spiked.

**Machine Learning Intern — Codsoft**  
Took machine learning from “cool idea” to “running in production.” Built data pipelines, trained models, and served them through APIs, focusing on accuracy, efficiency, and making ML actually useful outside a notebook.
